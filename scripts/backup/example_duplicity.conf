# Sample configuration file for backup_duplicity.sh.
#
# To automate this script, e.g. letting this script run by (ana)cron
# in the backup it's recommended to *not* use any clear text passwords
# for authentication.

# Instead, use a public/private key pair:

#
# It's also recommended to encrypt your backups in case you need/want to store
# it at some offsite location. For that the value PROFILE_GPG_KEY has to be set to the
# key you want to use.
